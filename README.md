#### A PHP website for interfacing with and controlling a DMP server.

This is a project I did a while back when I was getting started with PHP. It was designed to be an all singing and dancing [DarkMultiplayer](https://github.com/godarklight/DarkMultiPlayer) server web controller.

It uses PHP for all the backend stuff, with a basic templating system. The only exception to this is that, for some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to do all the server polling in browser, then report back to the backend. It wasn't.

This will probably never be released, if I wanted to start this again I'd start from scratch with a JS framework like all the cool kids use.

To function, it requires [my fork of DMP](https://github.com/Dan-Shields/DarkMultiPlayer), in case you're mad enough to want to use this...
